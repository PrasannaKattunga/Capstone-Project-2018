# Capstone-Project-2018
# Project: Using Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) data and Machine Learning to create a diagnostic tool

# Problem: 
Diagnosing of myocardial perfusion condition by analyzing â€œsingle proton emission computed tomography (SPECT" images.

# The Target Client/Audience: 
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that could be used by cardiologists as a second-opinion computer-based diagnostic tool. SPECT imaging is frequently used to diagnose patients with myocardial perfusion. From the medical point of view, the main benefit of using an algorithm is to semi-automate cardiac SPECT diagnostic process in order to assist physicians in diagnosing cardiac SPECT images, thereby making this procedure easier, more consistent, and efficient.

# Data Details: 
The source of the SPECT dataset is UCI repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SPECT+Heart. The SPECT dataset contains data on 267 patients. Each patient is classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. The SPECT image of each patient was processed to extract 44 continuous features that summarize the image. Thus, the dataset contains 267 rows (patients) and 45 attributes. 

# Deliverables: 
The project deliverables are R code, a final paper, and a slide deck will be posted in GitHub.
