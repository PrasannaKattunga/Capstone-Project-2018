# Capstone-Project-2018
# Project: Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)

# Problem: 
Diagnosing of cardiac “single proton emission computed tomography (SPECT) “ by analyzing SPECT images and identifying Normal and abnormality among patients with myocardial perfusion.

# The Target Client/Audience: 
This project is primarily designed for cardiologists and cardiology fellows as the second-opinion computer-based diagnostic tool. SPECT imaging is used as a diagnostic tool for myocardial perfusion for patients. From the medical point of view, the main goal is to semi-automate cardiac SPECT diagnostic process in order to assist a cardiologist in diagnosing cardiac SPECT images, to make this procedure easier, more consistent, and efficient.

# Data Details: 
The source of the dataset is from UCI.edu. The dataset of SPECT describes the diagnosing of cardiac SPECT images. Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. Two hundred and sixty-seven SPECT image sets (patients) were processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images. As a result, 44 continuous feature patterns were created for each patient. The CLIP3 algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns. The CLIP3 algorithm generated rules that were 77.0% accurate (as compared with cardiologists' diagnoses). SPECTF is a data set for testing ML algorithms; it has 267 instances that are described by 45 attributes. Predicted attribute: OVERALL_DIAGNOSIS (binary) 

# Deliverables: 
The project deliverables are R code, a final paper, and a slide deck will be posted in GitHub.
